# Differential Gene Expression Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of `limma`, a powerful R package used for differential gene expression analysis.

A dataset of cells from Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CLL) patients has been used as an example. `limma` has been used to identify genes that are differentially expressed in CLL cells compared to those without CLL.
