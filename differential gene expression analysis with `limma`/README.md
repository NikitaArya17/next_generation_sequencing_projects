# Differential Gene Expression Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of `limma`, a powerful R package for differential gene expression analysis. The basic workflow for this analysis was covered in the [Differential Expression Analysis with limma in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/differential-expression-analysis-with-limma-in-r) course, offered by John Blischak on DataCamp.

A dataset of cells from Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CLL) patients has been used as an example. This dataset was provided as part of the aforementioned course. `limma` has been used to identify genes that are differentially expressed in CLL cells compared to those without CLL.
