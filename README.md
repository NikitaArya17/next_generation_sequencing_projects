### Next Generation Sequencing
This repository features a series of independently conducted analyses of data generated from various next generation sequencing (NGS) experiments. The data used has been sourced from various papers, studies and tutorials. Each folder contains a separate type of analysis.

These projects represent an amateur undergraduate student's earliest attempts at acquiring and practising relevant skills in bioinformatics. As such, any inaccuracies or imperfections in the analyses are regretted.
