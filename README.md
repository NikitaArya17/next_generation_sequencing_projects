### Single-Cell RNA Sequencing
This repository features a series of independently conducted analyses of data generated from single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. The data used has been sourced from various papers and studies. Each folder contains a separate project.

The first folder contains an analysis of data generated in a study of cancer cell lines by Kinker et al., published in 2020.

These projects represent an amateur undergraduate student's earliest attempts at acquiring and practising relevant skills in bioinformatics. As such, any inaccuracies or imperfections in the analyses are regretted.
