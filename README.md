### Single-Cell RNA Sequencing
This repository features a series of independently conducted analyses of data generated from single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. The data used has been sourced from various papers and studies. Each folder contains a separate project. 

These projects represent an amateur undergraduate student's earliest attempts at acquiring and practising relevant skills in bioinformatics. As such, any inaccuracies or imperfections in the analyses are regretted.
