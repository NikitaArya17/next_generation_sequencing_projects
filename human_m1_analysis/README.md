It was obtained from the following paper:

[Bakken et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03465-8#Abs1)

A Kaggle notebook has been provided along with an R script. As the gene expression matrix was a large file of about 7 GB, the analysis was performed on Kaggle, which provides 30 GB of RAM.
